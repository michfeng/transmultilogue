10617 Final Project: Improving Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Using Multilogue-Net and Transformer Architecture

Final report linked [here](10617_final_report.pdf). 

Our model weights can be found in their respective Jupyter Notebooks. 

## File Structure 
### [transformer](transformer)
Folder containing Jupyter Notebook for our modified Multilogue-Net and transformer architecture; Jupyter Notebook contains instructions on how to run our model. Uses code from [Multilogue-Net](https://github.com/amanshenoy/multilogue-net). We modified the model file, training script and requirements file. Our [report](10617_final_report.pdf) explains in detail the theory behind our model. 

### [baseline](baseline) 
Folder containing Jupyter Notebook for our baseline model. Baseline model was taken from [MultiBench examples](https://github.com/pliang279/MultiBench/tree/main/examples). We modified one of the supervised training scripts to produce an output that would evaluate the MAE metric for training and validation samples. Our [report](10617_final_report.pdf) explains in detail the theory behind the baseline model.
